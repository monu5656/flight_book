									<h1>About us</h1>
								</header>
							<p><font size="3">Our team has spent over 25 years helping travel agents book airline seats to places beyond the reach of major global airlines. We are now making these connections available online to you. Our Airlines delivers great deals for reliable, secure and quick on-line bookings. We offer flights and unique combinations of flights to places that other online travel agencies ignore, using airlines you may not have experienced before or find offered elsewhere. We promise to give you the widest possible access to confirmed flight availability and you use your preferred payment card to get an immediate confirmation of your booking. Unlike some online sites, we do not restrict the choice of airlines to those who offer commission or marketing incentives. Our aim is to continually increase the number of airlines we offer and you decide which one or combination of airlines suits your individual needs the best.</font></p>
